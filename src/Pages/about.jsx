                    <h1 className='font-sans'>I'm Wei Zhen</h1>
                    <p>I'm an aspiring product designer based in Singapore. I'm passionate about creating an impactful and meaningful user experience through design. With my experiences in business and marketing, I am able to see through the lenses of users as well as businesses and empathise with them.</p>
                    <h3>Drive . Commitment . Gratitude .</h3>
                    <p>I hold these values dearly to my heart. That burning passion in me provides clarity in my purposes. Cultivating a habit is what keeps me committed to my goals. And gratitude is a reminder for me to appreciate the little things in life.</p>
                    <h3>What got me into product design?</h3>
                    <p>As an economics undergraduate, I learn to draw quantitative insights from a pool of data which brushes my numerical, analytical and problem-solving skills. It helps me to think strategically and make decisions to optimise the outcome. I got the opportunity to apply such soft skills during my marketing internships.</p>
                    <p>While I was interning in Shopee Singapore, I got lots of exposure in website design and wireframe creations as I was tasked to design thematic microsites such as cameras, video games and home appliances microsites. Often, I find myself enjoying that freedom to unleash my creativity through design. While doing my post-campaign analysis, I learnt how designs play a significant role in bounce rate, traffic and consumer retention.</p>
                    <p>As adventurous as I can be, I challenged myself to pick up HTML, CSS and react to code out my own website rather than using templates to deploy.</p>
                    <h3>TLDR</h3>
                    <p>It's been a long journey thus far but Iâ€™ve never regretted any of the choices made. My past experiences have equipped me with transferable skills and that accumulation of skills and experiences have moulded me into who I am today.</p>
